 * INSTRUMENT METAPHOR
 * ───────────────────
 * The manifold is the PIANO. The surface z = x · y over [0,1]²
 * already holds every note, every tone, every scale, every interval,
 * every sound this game can produce. Nothing is generated — every
 * outcome is *already there*, latent in the surface.
 *
 * A LENS is a MUSICIAN. It cannot produce a tone on its own. It must
 * STRIKE the manifold by *giving* it a coordinate (x, y) — a chosen
 * pair of normalised game dimensions. Only then does the manifold
 * answer with the tone z that was always sitting at that point.
 *
 *      give (x, y)  →  [ M A N I F O L D ]  →  receive z

 * Five lenses, five strikes:
 *   GameStateLens  strikes (level_progress × brick_density) → tension
 *   PhysicsLens    strikes (ball_speed     × tension)       → weight
 *   GraphicsLens   strikes (ball_advance   × threat)        → glow
 *   AudioLens      strikes (event_impact   × tension)       → power
 *   ScoreLens      strikes (combo_factor   × brick_value)   → bloom
 *
 * Rule: a lens never *computes* a value. It only *offers* coordinates
 * and *receives* the tone the manifold returns.

  // A piano does not COMPUTE its tones. A tone exists because of
  // the shape, length, tension and material of a string — a static
  // physical property of the instrument's body. Striking a key does
  // not create the tone; it merely OBSERVES the tone that the
  // string's geometry already implies.
  //
  // The manifold here is the same. Its SHAPE is fixed in advance:
  //
  //     SURFACE :  z  =  x · y     over   (x, y) ∈ [0, 1]²
  //
  // Every (x, y) point on that surface already has a z. The whole
  // continuum of tones — every note, every interval, every scale —
  // is *already there*, baked into the geometry. A lens cannot
  // produce a tone, change a tone, or compute a tone. A lens can
  // only OBSERVE one: hand the manifold a coordinate (x, y) and
  // receive back the z that was sitting at that point all along.
